Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Overview
This project predicts whether a person has heart disease based on clinical data. It applies several machine learning algorithms and compares their performance to identify the best predictive model.

Objective
The goal is to use medical parameters such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, and maximum heart rate to determine the likelihood of heart disease.

Dataset
The dataset used is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease).

You can also find the dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

Requirements
Install the required libraries before running the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
